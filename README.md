# U-Net-and-various-loss-function
This repository is for U-Net application, using ISBI 2012 dataset.

My project files are based on Colab pro and google cloud. Google cloud storage
should be over 100 giga byte for this project. This is because checkpoint saves about
17 giga byte in each model. So, I suggest that you upgrade google cloud. Colab pro
gives more GPU capacity which allows operating code faster. It is better to upgrade
Colab also. Also, all packages are already installed in Colab. No package installation
is required.
